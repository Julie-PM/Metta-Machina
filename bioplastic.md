### Descriptif
-----------------------------

For this third project, different objects made out of bioplastic were created. Some mold to cast object, some bioplastic film etc. 
Here you find the most achieved version of the Mold (and their respective casts) as well as the bioplastic films created. The failures are also depicted and explained.


### Steps
-----------------------------

> #### Step 1 - Create a mold

> ##### With Agar Agar and Milk

> ##### With Gelatine


> #### Step 2 - Cast your mold

> ##### With chocolate (What else!)
 I used melted chocolate to cast the mold. It was very easy to fill the gelatine mold. <br>
 I needed some help to open the AAM molds to properly filled them with chocolate. <br>
 I put all in the fridge for a full night.
 The results are astonishing for all molds.

> #### Step 3 - Create bioplastic film

> ##### Biofilm with threads
I used this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M_eDLyfzp8&ab_channel=GreenPlastics) to make my first bioplastic film. 
While the recipe is very easy - it was a true failure. <br>
Ingredients needed: <br>
1 table spoon starch <br>
4 table spoons water <br>
1 tea spoon glycerine<br>
1 tea spoon hite vinegar (I used cleaning vinegar) <br>

All ingredients have to mixed cold (with a spoon made out of silicon it is better) and then put on a stove and slowly heated until the mixure become transparent. Then the mix is poored into a silicon plate or mold (I used a cake mold). <br>
I added some threads to improve and strenhten the structure of my biofilm. <br>
After putting in the fridge for few hours, the results wasn't satisfying at all. It looks like a deadjelly fish. The film was easily breakable (by its own weight).<br>
I will have to do other trials.

### Results (Tadam!)
-----------------------------

> #### Agar Agar and Milk mold
The two Agar Agar & Milk mols are the one used to cast the shells.
The results are fantastic! A lot of details. It was easy to remove the cast from the mold. The molds can definitely be reused. While the mold are not very tasty they are fully eatable. <br>

The details of the chocolate shells are great. They look (and taste) yummy!

> #### Gelatine mold
The gelatine molds are the one with the rabits and the coin. The results are also satisfying. It was a little bit harder to remove the cast from the mold without damaging the mold itself. The molds are tastier but more fragile. <br>

You can see the details in the coin.

> #### Bioplastic film - Failed
Here the deadjellyfish like biofilm:
