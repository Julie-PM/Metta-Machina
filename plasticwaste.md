### Descriptif
-----------------------------

For this fourth project, plastic waste "consumed" in my household was collected during a week. <br>
The Household is living in house with a small garden in Leuven, Belgium, and is constitute of 2 adults: <br>
- a 30+ Swiss man unemployed (looking for a job opportunity in Belgium related to IT/Project management - we never know who read this website :-) )<br>
- a 20+ French woman employed as PhD candidate and 4.xx month pregnant during the experiment<br>
- a Hong Kong cat (short hair) with half a tail <br>
The household is vegetarian (except for the cat), but cheese eaters (except for the cat) <br>


A picture of the above-mentioned cat (named Pussy) in her favorite position (walking on the wall - everybody has a special skill)
