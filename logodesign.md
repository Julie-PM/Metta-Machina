### Descriptif
-----------------------------

For this second project, a logo had to be designed, laser cut, conceptualized in 3D modeling and modelled.
Here you find the most achieved version of the Metta-Machina logo (can also be used as a small version of a prject light ^^)


### Steps
-----------------------------

> #### Step 1 - Create the Metta-Machina Logo
> ##### In Power Point
The Logo was firstly design using the software "power point". The software was used due to is friendly userness and the non-need for previous background/knowledge.
It took me about 30min to design the logo.
First, I choosed a picture of a screw and of a screw driver from internet.
Second, I copied pasted them in the powerpoint application and deleted the parts I didn't want.
Third, I created a circular band to join the two tools.
Fourth, I added the "Metta-Machina" text (using the circular option).
Last but not least I choosed to all colored them in black.
The logo was saved as .jpg.

Here the logo of Metta-Machina - which can also be used to create a light projector<br>

> ##### In Inkscape

Download the .dxf file to lasercut the [logo](https://julie-pm.github.io/Metta-Machina/metta-machina.dxf)<br>


> #### Step 2 - Laser cut the logo
>

> #### Step 3 - 3D print the logo
